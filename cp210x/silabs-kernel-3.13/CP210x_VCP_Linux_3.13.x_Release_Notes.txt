This bundle contains a modified CP210x driver for the 3.13.0 kernel (Ubuntu 14.04).

It contains:

- Fix for CP2104, now sets the baudrate via "SET_BAUDRATE/GET_BAUDRATE" command
- Fix for CP2105, now stores the interface number for the device for multi interface support
- Fix to support GPIO on all parts
- Fix to correct control request for MHS, Line Control and Break support

NOTE: This driver is an example of how to perform GPIO operations within the CP210x driver since
the driver on kernel.org does not support GPIO at this time. This driver has only been written
and tested on the Linux 3.13.0 kernel on Ubuntu 14.04. This driver is a modified version of the
existing driver in the Linux 3.13.0 kernel, which is maintained at kernel.org. It is recommened
to use the driver there that matches your specific kernel version:

www.kernel.org

Build instrutions:

Ubuntu:
1. make ( your cp210x driver )
2. cp cp210x.ko to /lib/modules/<kernel-version>/kernel/drivers/usb/serial
3. insmod /lib/modules/<kernel-version/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/usbserial.ko
4. insmod cp210x.ko

RedHat:
1. yum update kernel*  //need to update the kernel first otherwise your header won't match
2. yum install kernel-devel kernel-headers  //get the devel and header packages.
3. reboot  //your build link should be fixed after your system come back
4. make ( your cp210x driver )  // should be able to build successfully at this point
5. cp cp210x.ko to /lib/modules/<kernel-version>/kernel/drivers/usb/serial
6a. insmod /lib/modules/<kernel-version/kernel/drivers/usb/serial/usbserial.ko
6. insmod cp210x.ko
7. sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0
8. sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB1


GPIO example:
This shows how to use the two IOCTLs to toggle GPIOs. This sample application simply reads
the GPIO settings from the device, flips it, then writes the new setting.

Build instructions:
1. g++ cp210x_gpio_example.c -o cp210x_gpio_example
2. ./cp210x_gpio_example
